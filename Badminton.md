## Answers
1. Badminton is not a backyard sport matter fact, it is the fastest racket sport in the world and was once the most popular sport on earth. Its spot quickly fell with more aggressive sports coming in front of it, such as football, basketball, and hockey. Although it isn't the most popular sport in the world, it is still not considered a backyard sport.
2. Yes, I have watched and played in many badminton games. Its so thrilling to watch the speeds at which the pros move at while hitting at an even faster speed and being so procise with all of their shots.
3. My favorite place to play badminton would be in Global Badminton Arena (The Arena in South California). The atmosphere is out of this world, with over 30 courts. There is little to no drift, and there are so many people all the time.
4. Yes, a rally is a continuous exchange of shots between players where the shuttle remains in play. I play them all the time.
5. My favorite badminton player currently is Shi Yuqi, a Chinese national player who's participated in multiple Olympics, and has a unique style of play that is unparalleled.
6. I started playing when I was around 4 because my dad taught badminton in a community center, and I found an interest in playing.
7. So far, the highlight of my career has been playing against the best players in the country and winning the entire tournament.
8. Throughout my badminton journey, my main supporters have been God, my family, and my coaches. Although not everyone can see my capabilities, they all have seen the best of me and believe that I can achieve great things. For that, I am grateful to all of them, and I thank God every day for always being by my side.
9. The most important tip I would give to a beginner would be, no matter how many times you lose, accept the loses because after loss over loss after loss, you will finally emerge victorious when you have truly accepted the loss.
10. My biggest motivation is my 10 year old self, and my 80-year-old self. I believe that I do need to fulfil 10-year-old me's dreams of winning the Olympics, but I also need to make sure 80-year-old me won't regret the time I spent while I was younger.
