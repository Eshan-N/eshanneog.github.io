# About me
## My Interests
I enjoy playing Badminton, volunteering at my local community center, and creating content for social media (check out the_shuttlezone on Instagram). While I'm not working on my outside activities, I'm most probably at school trying to survive the school day. My academic goals include attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), North Carolina State University (NC State), Duke University, or New York University (NYU). I would like to pursue a business degree from either of the colleges (most likely an MBA), but I would also like to major in Computer Science and Statistics. But my all-time goal is to go pro in Badminton and to become world number 1, hopefully, so I spend every day chasing my goals. 
## Websites I Recommend
My favorite websites of all time are
Google: https://www.google.com/ Google is and will always be the powerhouse of the internet. It is the best search engine ever created, and it helps foster the ingenuity of the upcoming generations by providing us with useful information and videos. 
Chat Gpt: https://chatgpt.com/ Although many teachers hate Chat GPT its still very usefull. It can help you think and come up with great ideas, and help you do anything you need to do in life. Yes, people cheat and plagerize off of it, but its smart AI techonology should be used for further developing your understanding of the world. 
YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/ YouTube is a hub for videos, some useful and some useless, but it is one of the most used apps in the world and it can help you with all of your daily needs and your thoughts. 
Gmail: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox Gmail is just my everyday email, but I love gmail because it keeps me up to date with all the importnat things I need to keep track of, and I always have something to check.
